The First World War: how did it start and who was to blame? 
Mar 5, 2018Arion Mc Nicoll The causes of the First World War are still being debated a century on, but time has led to some clarity8Credits Topical Press Agency Description This gallery provides a series of snapshots illustrating the way in which the First World War unfolded at home and abroad, and on land, in the air and over water. In this picture two airman, followed by a boy with a bike, make their way to a German zeppelin airship that had crash-landed in an Essex field in September 1916. This year marks the centenary of the Armistice, and the end of the First World War. See related Remembrance Day: why do we fall silent and wear poppies? Why the Battle of the Somme was so significant Fifteen great First World War poems But, 100 years on, debate still rages as to the causes behind a conflict which claimed the lives of 17 million people, traumatised a generation, overturned old empires and changed the world's political order forever. How did WWI start? The simplest answer is that the immediate cause was the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, the archduke of Austria-Hungary. His death at the hands of Gavrilo Princip – a Serbian nationalist with ties to the secretive military group known as the Black Hand – propelled the major European military powers towards war.

Click here to visit our frequently asked questions about HTML5 video.0:00 / 1:59The events that led up to the assassination are significantly more complicated, but most scholars agree that the gradual emergence of a group of alliances between major powers was partly to blame for the descent into war. By 1914, those alliances resulted in the six major powers of Europe coalescing into two broad groups: Britain, France and Russia formed the Triple Entente, while Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy comprised the Triple Alliance. As these countries came to each other's aid after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, their declarations of war produced a domino effect. CNN lists these key developments: June 28, 1914 - Gavrilo Princip assassinates Franz Ferdinand. July 28, 1914 - Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia. August 2, 1914 - Ottoman Empire (Turkey) and Germany sign a secret treaty of alliance. August 3, 1914 - Germany declares war on France. August 4, 1914 - Germany invades Belgium, leading Britain to declare war on Germany. August 10, 1914 - Austria-Hungary invades Russia. As the war progressed, further acts of aggression drew other countries, including the United States, into the conflict. Many others, including Australia, India and most African colonies, fought at the behest of their imperial rulers. But even the alliance theory is now considered overly simplistic by many historians. War came to Europe not by accident, but by design, argues military historian Gary Sheffield. According to Sheffield, the First World War began for two fundamental reasons: "First, decision-makers in Berlin and Vienna chose to pursue a course that they hoped would bring about significant political advantages even if it brought about general war. Second, the governments in the entente states rose to the challenge. "Sheffield adds: "At best, Germany and Austria-Hungary launched a reckless gamble that went badly wrong. At worst, 1914 saw a premeditated war of aggression and conquest, a conflict that proved to be far removed from the swift and decisive venture that some had envisaged". Was WWI caused by a family feud? Far from being remote rulers who knew nothing of their enemies, the heads of state of Britain, Germany and Russia – George V, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Tsar Nicholas II – were first cousins who knew one another very well. A BBC documentary screened earlier this year, Royal Cousins at War, told the story of Wilhelm's difficult relationship with his parents and antipathy towards all things British and argues that this helped bring the world to the brink of war. The three monarchs were like "sleepwalkers stepping towards an open lift shaft", Richard Davenport-Hines says in his review of Miranda Carter's book on the subject, The Three Emperors. The events leading up to the conflict are "a study in the envy, insincerity, festering rancour and muddle that only families can manage". Unlike many family feuds, however, disagreements between the royal cousins exacted a geopolitical price. "As relationships between the royal cousins waxed and waned, so did the relationships between their countries," the Daily Mail's Ruth Styles says. Queen Victoria attempted to broker peace between the cousins, but after her death good will "between the Russian, British and German branches of the family dissipated and Europe edged closer to war: George V and Tsar Nicholas on one side, and their estranged cousin, Wilhelm, on the other," Styles says. The engagement was disastrous for all three monarchs. By the end of 1918 the German kaiser was deposed and had fled into exile, the Russian tsar and his children had been executed by revolutionaries, and the British king presided over "a broken, debt-ridden empire," Davenport-Hines says. Which nation was the primary aggressor? The question of which country or countries caused the war is sometimes flipped on its head by scholars who have asked which countries – had they conducted themselves differently – could have prevented it. On the BBC website, military historian Sir Max Hastings says that while no one nation deserves the blame alone, Germany is more guilty than most, as "it alone had power to halt the descent to disaster at any time in July 1914 by withdrawing its 'blank cheque' which offered support to Austria for its invasion of Serbia. "Sir Richard J Evans, Regius professor of history at the University of Cambridge disagrees, arguing that Serbian nationalism and expansionism were the root cause of the conflict. "Serbia bore the greatest responsibility for the outbreak of WW1," Evans says, "and Serbian backing for the Black Hand terrorists was extraordinarily irresponsible,"Other leading scholars believe the blame should be shared equally between all the main players: Austria-Hungary, Germany, Serbia, Russia, France, the Ottoman empire and Britain. The "fatal mixture of political misjudgement, fear of loss of prestige and stubborn commitments on all sides of a very complicated system of military and political alliances of European states" led to the descent into all-out war. Why did the US join the war? Until the US Congress declared war on Germany in April 1917, President Woodrow Wilson "had strained every political sinew" to keep the country out of the conflict, author Patrick Gregory writes for the BBC. Despite widespread horror in the US over newspaper reports of German atrocities against civilians, the general feeling among in the early months of the conflict was that American men should not risk their lives in a European war. That all started to change in May 1915, when a German U-boat torpedoed and sank the British passenger liner the Lusitania as it crossed the Atlantic, killing 1,198 of the 1,962 people on board. The attack provoked shock and fury across the world. Among the dead were 128 Americans, putting substantial pressure on the government to abandon its neutral stance on the conflict. Although ambivalence to the war remained strong enough that Wilson campaigned for reelection in 1916 on the slogan "He kept us out of war", Gregory writes, the Lusitania atrocity swelled the ranks of the pro-war lobby, led by former president Theodore Roosevelt. In response to the outcry, Kaiser Wilhelm II halted U-boat operations in the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the pro-war sentiment in the US continued to fester - and when Germany announced plans to resume its naval strikes on passenger ships in January 1917, it exploded. Public opinion was further inflamed, writes Gregory, over the emergence of a telegram, supposedly from the German foreign minister Arthur Zimmerman to Mexico offering military assistance if the US entered the war. Observers soon came to believe that the change in public feeling made US entry into the war inevitable, and eight weeks later Congress approved a resolution declaring war on Germany. The Anglo-German arms race Towards the end of the 19th century, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany embarked on a massive project to build a fleet that would rival Great Britain's. The Royal Navy at the time was regarded as the most powerful in the world, although its primary purpose was not military, but the protection of trade. "Britain relied upon imports and its economic prosperity rested on seaborne trade, financed by the City of London," Paul Cornish, the senior curator at the Imperial War Museum, says. "Any threat to Britain's naval supremacy was a threat to the nation itself. "A shipbuilding arms race with Germany began in 1898, but Britain had gained a technological edge over its rival by 1906, with the development of a new class of battleship – the dreadnought. "Designed around the firepower of heavy guns and powered by steam turbines, these huge vessels made all earlier warships obsolete," Cornish adds. "In both countries, the public, encouraged by the press, popular authors and naval pressure groups, demanded more battleships. "Ultimately, Germany was unable to keep pace with the spending power of its rival and shifted attention away from its navy back to the development of its army. However, "the damage to Germany’s relationship with Britain proved irreversible". Is it wrong to try to point the finger? Attempting to identify which nation or nations should be held accountable for the war is an exercise doomed to failure, Margaret Mac Millan argues in her 2013 First World War history, The War that Ended Peace. In her Spectator review of Mac Millan's "important new study", Jane Ridley says that the book's main thrust is that the blame game itself is "conceptually flawed". "The alternative to searching for scapegoats is to examine the system," Mac Millan argues "and the international system in 1914 was seriously dysfunctional".

Neurons and Their Role in the Nervous System 
Theories Biological Psychology Neurons and Their Role in the Nervous System How neurons transmit information throughout the body By Kendra Cherry | Reviewed by Steven Gans, MDUpdated November 06, 2017Share Pin Email Print Science Photo Library - KTSDESIGN/Getty Images A neuron is a nerve cell that is the basic building block of the nervous system. Neurons are similar to other cells in the human body in a number of ways, but there is one key difference between neurons and other cells. Neurons are specialized to transmit information throughout the body. These highly specialized nerve cells are responsible for communicating information in both chemical and electrical forms. There are also several different types of neurons responsible for different tasks in the human body. Sensory neurons carry information from the sensory receptor cells throughout the body to the brain. Motor neurons transmit information from the brain to the muscles of the body. Interneurons are responsible for communicating information between different neurons in the body. Neurons vs. Other Cells Similarities with other cells: Neurons and other body cells both contain a nucleus that holds genetic information. Neurons and other body cells are surrounded by a membrane that protects the cell. The cell bodies of both cell types contain organelles that support the life of the cell, including mitochondria, Golgi bodies, and cytoplasm. Differences that make neurons unique: Unlike other body cells, neurons stop reproducing shortly after birth. Because of this, some parts of the brain have more neurons at birth than later in life because neurons die but are not replaced. While neurons do not reproduce in most areas of the brain, research has shown that new connections between neurons form throughout life. Neurogenesis, or the formation of new nerve cells, does occur in some parts of the brain throughout life. Neurons have a membrane that is designed to send information to other cells. The axon and dendrites are specialized structures designed to transmit and receive information. The connections between cells are known as synapses. Neurons release chemicals known as neurotransmitters into these synapses to communicate with other neurons. The Structure of a Neuron There are three basic parts of a neuron: the dendrites, the cell body, and the axon. However, all neurons vary somewhat in size, shape, and characteristics depending on the function and role of the neuron. Some neurons have few dendritic branches, while others are highly branched in order to receive a great deal of information. Some neurons have short axons, while others can be quite long. The longest axon in the human body extends from the bottom of the spine to the big toe and averages a length of approximately three feet!Action Potentials How do neurons transmit and receive information? In order for neurons to communicate, they need to transmit information both within the neuron and from one neuron to the next. This process utilizes both electrical signals as well as chemical messengers. The dendrites of neurons receive information from sensory receptors or other neurons. This information is then passed down to the cell body and on to the axon. Once the information has arrived at the axon, it travels down the length of the axon in the form of an electrical signal known as an action potential. Communication Between Synapses Once an electrical impulse has reached the end of an axon, the information must be transmitted across the synaptic gap to the dendrites of the adjoining neuron. In some cases, the electrical signal can almost instantaneously bridge the gap between the neurons and continue along its path. In other cases, neurotransmitters are needed to send the information from one neuron to the next. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that are released from the axon terminals to cross the synaptic gap and reach the receptor sites of other neurons. In a process known as reuptake, these neurotransmitters attach to the receptor site and are reabsorbed by the neuron to be reused. Neurotransmitters Neurotransmitters are an essential part of our everyday functioning. While it is not known exactly how many neurotransmitters exist, scientists have identified more than 100 of these chemical messengers. What effects does each of these neurotransmitters have on the body? What happens when disease or drugs interfere with these chemical messengers? The following are just a few of the major neurotransmitters, their known effects, and disorders they are associated with. Acetylcholine: Associated with memory, muscle contractions, and learning. A lack of acetylcholine in the brain is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Endorphins: Associated with emotions and pain perception. The body releases endorphins in response to fear or trauma. These chemical messengers are similar to opiate drugs such as morphine but are significantly stronger. Dopamine: Associated with thought and pleasurable feelings. Parkinson’s disease is one illness associated with deficits in dopamine. Doctors may prescribe medications that can increase dopamine activity in the brain. One category is dopamine agonists, which mimic the effects of dopamine. Another type of agent is levodopa, which is converted into dopamine in the brain. They each carry their own relative benefits and side effects. Researchers also have found strong links between schizophrenia and excessive amounts of dopamine in certain parts of the brain.

The lumbar spine typically has five vertebrae, though some people range from four to six vertebrae in the lumbar region. The purpose of the lumbar spine is to stabilize and support the weight of the body, while still allowing the spine to move and bend freely. Because of the versatile nature of the lumbar spine, the vertebrae in this area are prone to injury and the development of spine conditions. The L3 vertebra is particularly susceptible to injury because it is the middle vertebra in the lumbar spine, which means it handles the most stress when the lumbar twists and bends. Additionally, when people lift heavy objects incorrectly, most of the damage is done to the L3 vertebra. Spine conditions that affect the L3 vertebra Spine conditions tend to increase as we age due to excess weight and the natural compression of the vertebrae on the discs and joints found in between each vertebra. The L3 vertebra holds most of the weight and stress of the body compared to the other vertebrae in the lumbar spine. Because of this, there are several spine conditions that can develop at the L3 vertebra and impact the surrounding nerve root, disc and/or joint. The most common spine conditions at the L3 vertebra include: Herniated disc Bulging disc Bone spurs Spondylosis Spondylolisthesis Arthritis of the spine There are several other conditions that may develop as a result of vertebral compression in the lumbar spine, which often impacts the disc and joints in the spine. If a spine condition occurs in the L3 vertebra, the symptoms will likely include chronic lower back pain and radiating pain in the buttock and leg of the impacted side. Additionally, the leg and foot might feel weak and numb due to the impacted nerve root being unable to send strong signals to the extremities. Treatment options for L3 vertebra pain If you are experiencing these symptoms, we encourage you to contact our dedicated team at Laser Spine Institute. We are here to inform you about your spine condition and the conservative and surgical treatment options available to you.
